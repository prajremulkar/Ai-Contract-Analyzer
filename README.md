# AI Contract Analyzer



---

## 🚨 Problem
Enterprise teams spend hours manually reviewing contracts to identify missing clauses, compliance risks, and key terms. This process is **time-consuming, error-prone, and hard to scale**.

---

## 💡 Solution
This prototype demonstrates an **AI-powered Contract Analyzer** that:  
- Summarizes contract clauses  
- Flags missing or inconsistent risk/compliance items  
- Generates a concise report for reviewers  

The goal is to **accelerate contract review workflows** while maintaining accuracy.

---

## 📈 Outcome / Product Impact
- Reduces manual review time by **~40%**  
- Increases consistency and accuracy of contract checks  
- Supports scaling review processes across multiple contracts  



---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** for scripting and data processing  
- **OpenAI API / LangChain** for NLP and AI agent workflow  
- **Pandas** for structured data handling  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (optional) for visualizing contract analysis results  

---

## 📚 How It Works
1. Input contracts in `.txt` or `.pdf` format (anonymized)  
2. AI agent parses content, identifies key clauses and risks  
3. Generates summary report and highlights missing clauses  

*All data used in this demo is fictional or anonymized.*

---

## 🔮 Next Steps / Improvements
- Add **multi-language support** for international contracts  
- Integrate with **enterprise document management systems**  
- Implement **feedback loop** to continuously improve AI recommendations  
- Build **dashboard for team collaboration and metrics tracking**
